I am an AI & Computer Vision Engineer with applied experience in object detection, neural networks, transfer learning, and fine-tuning. I have worked extensively with YOLO architectures, applying them to improve detection accuracy in complex and large-scale environments. My expertise also covers designing and optimizing end-to-end machine learning workflows, from model development and training to performance tuning.
Beyond object detection, I bring strong knowledge of CNNs, RNNs, and optimization algorithms, which I continue to refine through research and applied projects. I am passionate about transforming advanced deep learning methods into scalable, real-world AI solutions, and I thrive in collaborative environments where innovation drives measurable impact.
